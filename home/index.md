# Welcome!
My name is **Marcos**, but you may know me as **octoshrimpy**.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for [open-source projects](https://github.com/octoshrimpy?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers), and I contribute to them on a [weekly basis](https://github.com/octoshrimpy?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=). I write most of my code in Javascript/HTML/CSS, though I also dabble in Python, Go, Lua, with history in PHP, Java, C# and a few others.

[I've worked on almost every side of the tech industry](https://github.com/octoshrimpy/octoshrimpy/blob/main/Marcos%20Jones.pdf), from on-premise syadmin to mobile phone repairman with resoldering xbox chips on the side. I've fixed broken mobility scooters and 4K TVs, too.

I don't limit myself to software, having modded a casio watch recently, with a few arduino projects coming soonâ„¢.
