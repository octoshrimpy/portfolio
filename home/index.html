# Welcome!
My name is **Marcos**, but you may know me as **octoshrimpy**.

I'm a software engineer with a passion for [open-source projects](//), 
and I contribute to them on a [weekly basis](//). 
I write most of my code in Javascript/HTML/CSS, though I also dabble in 
Python, Go, Lua, with history in PHP, Java, C# and a few others.

[I've worked on almost every side of the tech industry](//), 
from on-premise syadmin to mobile phone repairman with resoldering 
xbox chips on the side. I've fixed broken mobility scooters and 4K TVs too.

I don't limit myself to software, having modded a casio watch recently, 
with a few arduino projects coming soonâ„¢.


You can find link to my projects (as well as socials) down in the footer!
